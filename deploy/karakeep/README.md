# Karakeep with Tailscale Sidecar Configuration  

This Docker Compose configuration sets up **[Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep)** with Tailscale as a sidecar container to securely manage and access your self-hosted notes and collaboration app over a private Tailscale network. By integrating Tailscale, you can ensure that your Karakeep instance is only accessible to authorized devices within your Tailscale network, protecting your ideas and information from the public web.

## Karakeep  

[Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep) is an **open-source, self-hosted alternative to Google Keep**, designed for simple note-taking and fast access. It supports collaborative editing, Markdown formatting, drag-and-drop organization, and tagging. Karakeep offers a clean, modern interface and is ideal for individuals or teams who want a privacy-focused, cloud-free way to manage notes and ideas.

## Key Features  

- **Simple Note-Taking** – Create and organize notes with a beautiful, fast UI.  
- **Collaborative Editing** – Share and edit notes in real time with others.  
- **Markdown Support** – Use lightweight formatting for structured notes.  
- **Tagging and Organization** – Categorize and manage content with tags and drag-and-drop.  
- **Self-Hosted & Private** – Own your data, free from third-party cloud services.  
- **Secure Access with Tailscale** – Restrict access to your notes using your private Tailscale network.

## Configuration Overview  

In this setup, the `tailscale-karakeep` service runs Tailscale, which manages secure networking for the Karakeep service. The `karakeep` service uses the Tailscale network stack via Docker's `network_mode: service:` configuration. This ensures that Karakeep’s web interface is only accessible through the Tailscale network (or locally, if preferred), enhancing the privacy and security of your notes and collaborative workspace.
